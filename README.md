# Auth0 ♥️ React Workshop

This repository is setup to facilitate a hands-on workshop with authentication in React using Auth0.

*For the hands-on portion, you will follow this blog post, [The Complete Guide to React User Authentication](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/), created by [Dan Arias](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/dan-arias/). Thanks Dan!*

## About this Repository

In this workshop, you'll learn about several crucial concepts.

- modern authentication workflows
- handling authentication in React using React Hooks, Context API, etc.
- JSON Web Tokens
- securely calling APIs

During the hands-on portion, you'll follow **[this article](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)** for the detailed walkthrough. In that article, the frontend and backend projects are in two different repositories. **However, this repository already includes both projects, a React frontend and a Node/Express backend**.

Two important notes on  this...

> 1. When the blog post mentions the `auth0-react-sample` directory in the *Get the Starter Application* section, you will instead use the `frontend` directory from this repository.

> 2. When the blog post mentions the `auth0-express-js-sample` directory in the *Calling an API* section, you will instead use the `backend` directory from this repository.

### Branches

Each step has a corresponding branch with the starting code for that step. If you get behind, you can always skip ahead by checking out the next branch.

For example, if you are on Step 1, you would check out the `step-1` branch. To get the finished code from Step 1, you would check out the `step-2` branch.

## Sign up for Auth0

 If you haven't already, [sign up for a free Auth0 account](https://a0.to/react-workshop-signup), which offers you:

* 7,000 [free active users and unlimited logins](https://auth0.com/pricing/).
* A [centralized, ready-to-ship login page](https://auth0.com/universal-login) for Web, iOS & Android.
* Up to 2 [social identity providers](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-social) like Google and Facebook login.
* Unlimited [serverless Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current) to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities.

During the sign-up process, you create something called an [Auth0 Tenant](https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/the-basics#account-and-tenants), which is a container that Auth0 uses to store your identity service configuration and your users in isolation. No other Auth0 customer can peek into or access your tenant.
